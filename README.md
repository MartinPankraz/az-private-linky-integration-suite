# az-private-linky-integration-suite

Find my blog post series on the topic [here](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/07/02/whatever-happens-in-an-azure-and-btp-private-linky-swear-stays-in-the-linky-swear/).

The package contains two iFlows. One configured against the CAP implementation and one for Java. They differ due to the chosen router configuration. They can be adapted as required.
